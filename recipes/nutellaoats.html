    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       This recipe for Nutella oats is perfect for Nutella lovers like myself.
       This is the only way I can manage to eat oats without them tasting bland.
       In general, oats are very good for heart health and help people with
       heart conditions. Another benefit of eating oats is that they keep you full for
       a long time. This is especially helpful when you tend to get hungry well before
       lunch. For this recipe, feel free to use any kinds of oats as the recipe will be very similar for all.
