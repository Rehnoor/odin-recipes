     <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This simple and boring recipe for scrambled eggs has taken inspiration from
        the famous <em>Gordon Ramsay</em>'s scrambled eggs recipe. I love the original recipe,
        but I like to add some extra protein to truly make it mine.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 eggs (adjust based on protein/fat goals)</li>
        <li>A knob of buttah (as Gordon says)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped veggies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a cold pan, crack in your eggs and <strong>do not</strong> turn on the heat</li>
        <li>Put in your knob of butter and start whisking the eggs with a soft spatula (wooden/silicone)</li>
        <li>Turn on your heat to medium low and continue to whisk constantly. Keep agitating the eggs like I agitate my girlfriend.
            The key is to not let your eggs stay still in the pan for too long.
        </li>
        <li>If your eggs start cooking more, movie them on and off heat while continuing to stir</li>
        <li>Once your eggs are starting to clump and get the texture of mayo, take them off the heat</li>
        <li>Stir in your salt, pepper, cottage cheese, and veggies</li>
        <li>Now add back to the heat and continue stiring</li>
        <li>Continue to stir and cook until the eggs have reached your desired consistancy. Once done,
            plate and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
