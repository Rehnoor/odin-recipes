    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This high protein french toast recipe is a very customizable, delicious, and healthy recipe for
        gym buffs like myself. It is very simple and can be put together very fast for a filling breakfast.
        This recipe yields 2 pieces of french toast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pretty much anything in the recipe can be customized.
        You can use any type of bread to yield 2 pieces of French Toast.
        For the nut butter, you can use any nut butter you prefer (even Nutella!).
        You may adjust the amount of eggs to get more protein or make your toast more
        "eggy". As for milk, you may use any percent of cow milk or any alternatives you prefer.
        As for the fruits, I like to use bananas or strawberries but feel free to use any fruit!
